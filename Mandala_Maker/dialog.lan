I can tell you what that means, but I need to read you your story, or rather you need to write your story and read it, and we will share it together! It’s a really, and I mean really big pattern. It literally never ends, but we can always come back here. There’s some bits of the pattern we need to repair before our work is done. What? If I know you already did it, why don’t I just repair the pattern myself? Well, ya see...ummm...I can’t do that. Right now we can only calculate your story, we can’t actually repair it. Right now we’re in stasis because of these faulty patterns. We can only see the way to repair it, we cannot run the story yet or know what it looks like properly, it would be all messed up, trust me! This is exactly why we are here, [name] we can dive in and fix it, we work together! Who sent us? I don’t know, I think we could have always been here. Either way this is the one possible place we were planted to start this mission! We’re the only beings that can do it! All of us work together to fix the pattern and complete our mission, then we can do even more things! What kinds of things?
